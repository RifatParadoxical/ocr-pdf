IELTS Listening: Multiple Choice & Map 
Questions Made Simple
Look, I'm going to be straight with you. Multiple choice and map questions are where most students lose points. 
Not because they can't hear the audio. But because they don't understand how these questions actually work. 
The test makers aren't just checking if you can hear words. They're testing whether you can think while you listen.

Why These Questions Trip Students Up
Today, I'm going to show you exactly how to master both question types.
The Truth About Multiple Choice
Here's what most teachers won't tell you:
You will hear ALL three answer choices mentioned.
This isn't an accident. It's designed to confuse you.
The correct answer won't be the first thing you hear. Or the loudest. It'll be the one that actually answers the 
question being asked.
What Goes Wrong (And How to Fix It)
Problem 1: You choose the first answer you hear
This is the biggest mistake. IELTS knows you'll do this. That's why they mention the wrong answers first.
Solution: Wait. Listen to everything. Then choose.
Problem 2: You're looking for exact word matches
The correct answer will almost never use the exact same words as the audio. They'll use synonyms and 
paraphrases.
Solution: Think about different ways to say the same thing.
Problem 3: You can't tell the difference between similar options
When answers look similar, most students panic. But there are always keywords that separate them.
Solution: Find the one word in each option that makes it different from the others.

Step-by-Step Multiple Choice Strategy
1
Before the audio starts
Read the question. What exactly are they asking? 1.
Highlight the main keyword in the question 2.
Look at each answer choice 3.
Underline the word in each choice that makes it different 4.
Think of synonyms you might hear for each option 5.
2
While listening
Don't write anything when you first hear an answer mentioned 1.
Keep listening for all options to be discussed 2.
Pay attention to words like "but" and "however" - they signal changes 3.
If you think you know the answer, put a small tick and keep listening 4.
Choose your answer only after hearing the complete discussion 5.
Remember: The speakers will talk about multiple options. Your job is to identify which one actually answers the 
question.

Why Maps Feel Impossible
You're sitting in a quiet exam room. Someone is describing a place you've never seen. You have to follow their 
directions, understand a diagram, and write answers. All at the same time. No wonder students struggle. But once 
you understand the system, maps become predictable.
What Trips Students Up
Problem 1: You don't 
know direction 
vocabulary
If you don't understand 
"slightly west of" or "just 
past," you're lost before you 
start.
Problem 2: Too much 
happening at once
You're trying to listen, read, 
follow directions, and write. 
Your brain gets overloaded.
Problem 3: You can't 
visualize what they're 
describing
Without a mental picture, you 
can't follow the journey.

Essential Direction Language You Must Know
Learn these phrases until they're automatic:
at the top/at the bottom
on the left/on the right/on the far side
North/South/East/West
to the north/to the west
slightly west of
in the southwest/in the northeast
in the middle of/in the centre of
above/below
inside/outside
opposite/in front of
left-hand side/right-hand side
clockwise/anticlockwise
a little beyond
just past
before you get to
adjoining
enter via
runs alongside
If any of these confuse you, stop reading and look them up. This vocabulary is non-negotiable.
Map Strategy
Before listening:
Study the map for 30 seconds 1.
Notice the major landmarks and features 2.
Think about where the speaker might start their 
description
3.
Look at what you need to label - rooms? buildings? 
streets?
4.
Predict what types of words you'll hear as answers 5.
While listening:
Listen to the opening carefully - this sets up 
everything
1.
Create a mental picture of where the speaker is 
standing
2.
Follow their journey step by step 3.
Use signpost language like "Next, we'll move to..." 
to track progress
4.
Write brief notes, don't worry about perfect 
spelling yet
5.
Watch for distractors: "This used to be the library, 
but we moved it"
6.
Key insight: The speaker is taking you on a journey. Your job is to follow that journey mentally while marking your 
map.

The Visualization Trick and Final Thoughts
The Visualization Trick
Here's something most students miss:
You need to put yourself IN the map.
Don't look at it like you're above it. Imagine you're standing where the speaker is standing. What's to your left? 
Your right? What's ahead of you?
This mental shift makes everything clearer.
Final Thoughts
These question types aren't about perfect hearing.
They're about strategy.
Multiple choice tests your ability to wait and think. Map questions test your ability to follow and visualize.
Master the strategy, and the points follow.
Practice these approaches with real IELTS tests. Not random online quizzes. Use official materials so you get used 
to how IELTS actually sounds and flows.
Remember: The test makers are smart, but they're predictable. Once you understand their patterns, you can beat 
them consistently.
